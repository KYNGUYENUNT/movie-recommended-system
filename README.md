# movie-recommended-system
A movie recommendation system based on user preferences
This project builds a content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity between movie feature vectors. The system takes a movie selected by the user and recommends the most similar movies, along with their posters, using the TMDB API. The app is deployed with Streamlit for an interactive frontend.
